# Why

I would like to be able to write my tests in the same directory as the code they
are testing.

# How to run

```
git clone https://github.com/JuanCaicedo/elm-local-test
cd elm-local-test
elm test src/*Test.elm                                                                                                                                               │·
```

# Result

```
It looks like you're running elm-test from within your tests directory.                                                                                                                │·
                                                                                                                                                                                       │·
Please run elm-test from your project's root directory, where its elm-package.json lives!
